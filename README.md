Mosquito I synth for Arduino

Mosquito I is a synthesizer that runs on an Arduino. It uses the Mozzi synthesis library for sound generation. This repository includes a schematic that shows hardware setup/connections as well as the Arduino code.

Installation:

1. Setup the hardware per the schematic.
2. Download and install the Mozzi library from https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/ using instructions on that page.
3. Connect the Arduino to your computer and upload the mosquitoI.ino sketch.

Code can be easily modified to use different Mozzi oscillators or to change/add arpeggio sequences as annotated in the code.
